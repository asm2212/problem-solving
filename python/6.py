# An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

# In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

# The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
# The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
# The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
# This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years. Source

# Task

# Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.

# Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.

# Input Format

# Read , the year to test.

# Constraints


# Output Format

# The function must return a Boolean value (True/False). Output is handled by the provided code stub.

# Sample Input 0

# 1990
# Sample Output 0

# False
# Explanation 0

# 1990 is not a multiple of 4 hence it's not a leap year.
